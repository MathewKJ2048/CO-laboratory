The binary file generated has a .bin extension
the file consists of '1's,'0's and '2's
each command's binary representation is made up of '0' (\u0048) and '1' (\u0049)
'2' serves as a line seperator between instructions

justification:
1) allows easier debugging in the initial stage
2) allows implementation of variable-length instructions in the future

Note that this format can be changed in the future in case of any issues
